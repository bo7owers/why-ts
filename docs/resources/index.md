# TS Resources

- [TypeScript Deep Dive by Basarat Ali Syed](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/) is in my opinion one of the best places to learn TS, I find it a little easier than the official documentation. It is free and open source too!

- [TypeScript Official Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), by Microsoft, has all you need but the readings may get a little exhausting.
- [The Vue 3 documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#using-vue-with-typescript). Even though you can use everything you learn from the previous resources in Vue, someitmes you'll find errors specific to Vue or the [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#composition-api).
- [The Fireship YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship). Jeff covers different topics in the Programming world (though he focuses mostly on web dev). His style may not be for everyone but it is definitely worth the try.
- [The Net Ninja's Vue 3 TS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfI5PISLr9w&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gCtAuEdXTjNVE5bbMFo5OD). This is going to give you a good understanding on how to implement TypeScript to your Vue 3 projects.
